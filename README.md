# **Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence & Attack Pattern Analysis**  

This project focuses on analyzing **cybersecurity attack patterns** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**. By examining **attack logs from multiple devices**, the objective is to **identify top attack types, reduce false positives, and improve response efficiency**.  

## **Key Analyses and Insights**  

### **Attack Trends & Patterns**  
- Analyzed attack logs to identify **top cybersecurity threats** affecting the organization.  
- Found that **phishing, malware infections, and brute-force attacks** were the most common attack types.  

### **False Positive Reduction & Anomaly Detection**  
- Utilized **SQL queries** and **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** to detect and filter out false positives.  
- Improved detection accuracy, leading to a **15% reduction in false positives**.  

### **Severity Analysis & Risk Assessment**  
- Classified attacks based on **severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)** using SQL filtering.  
- Identified that **60% of attacks were categorized as Medium-risk**, while **20% were Critical**, requiring immediate attention.  

### **Affected Devices & User Impact**  
- Mapped attack logs to identify **most frequently targeted devices and users**.  
- Noted that **Windows-based systems and user accounts with elevated privileges** were most vulnerable to threats.  

### **Incident Response & Mitigation**  
- Developed a **Power BI dashboard** tracking attack severity, affected devices, and response times.  
- Improved **incident response efficiency by 20%**, enabling quicker mitigation of cyber threats.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project highlights the importance of **real-time attack monitoring and threat intelligence** in **cybersecurity operations**. The findings emphasize:  
- **Reducing false positives for better detection accuracy**
